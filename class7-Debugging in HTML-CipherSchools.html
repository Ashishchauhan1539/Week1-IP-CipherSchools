    <h2> paragraph </h2>
    <p>

        A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. 
        Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or 
        a group of sentences that support one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time 
        to your broader argument.
